                    You donâ€™t really want AI, you want answers. Getting them today <br />takes months - or years - and costs millions of dollars. <br />
                    What if you could get around the problem of needing massive <br />amounts of human-labeled data? What if you could use AI to get <br />critical insights - even when data is unstructured or sparse? <br />
                    Instead of needing months of human labeling to have some base <br />AI performance in a new situation, RAIC can get to work <br />immediately, radically reducing the latency between data <br />collection and actionable insights.
